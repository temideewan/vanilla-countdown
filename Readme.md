# Vanilla countdown timer

This countdown timer made with pure HTML CSS and JavaScript does exactly what it says.

It accepts an input event and a target date that is in the future and counts down to the event

## Some things learned

- I learned a lot about [javascript dates](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) from the constructor and also used some of the inbuilt functions
- Also used the inbuilt [setTimeOut()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) for creating the countdown functionality.
